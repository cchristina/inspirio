# BITSPIRATION


This project started out with a simple promptâ€“ make a spoof of an instagram inspiration quote, and I found myself faced with a problem: I'm not that funny on the fly. So, I decided to see if I could generate some funny text that was a plausible quote, and found myself a little bit carried away. This started as a simple jupyter notebook working a quote dataset I found on kaggle [source](https://www.kaggle.com/akmittal/quotes-dataset), to ultimately figuring out how to automate the image generation, too.
